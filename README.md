 📜 ABOUT THE PROJECT

   User-friendly password generator let users select features that users wants to include in their passwords. 
Firstly user can choose his/her password's length which can be a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 24. I choose a minimum of 4 because people can use this app for their credit card password. I choose a maximum of 24 because of memorization. One thing users must avoid is storing passwords on their computers can be very dangerous. Remembering or writing down them not on electronic devices is still the best way to store passwords safely. In the features part, users have 4 options these are uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Users can choose whatever they want to generate their passwords. It is also certain that can be more safely choosing all of them.
